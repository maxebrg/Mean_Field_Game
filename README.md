# Mean_Field_Game
This project focuses on the study of Mean Field Games (MFG) with congestion effects. MFGs were
introduced by J-M. Lasry and P-L. Lions to analyze deterministic or stochastic differential games when
the number of players tends to infinity. In this framework, players are assumed to be indistinguishable and
have a negligible influence on the game. Each individual strategy is influenced by averages of quantities
depending on the states or controls of the other players.

The objective of this project is to numerically simulate MFGs with congestion effects using finite
difference schemes. We will also compare the results obtained with those of a Mean Field Control (MFC)
problem.
